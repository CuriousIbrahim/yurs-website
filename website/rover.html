      <h2>Vice President, Events and Outreach</h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      The VPEO would attend to the planning and scheduling of events for YURS.
      YURS has a constitutional objective of outreach, and to that end, the VPEO
      can schedule workshops, tours, school visits, and various other activities
      as deemed necessary to that end. The VPEO shall be responsible for
      establishing, maintaining, and preserving contacts between YURS and such
      organizations as may be contacted from time to time for the purpose of
      events or outreach activities. Coming off a year where little outreach was
      possible, the VPEO will have a chance to make a big impact as we hopefully
      return to a "normal" school year. This position is a full executive
      position, which means that there is a considerable role in club affairs,
      though it does not have signing authority.

      you! Designed in Fusion 360, examples of parts that the mechanical team
