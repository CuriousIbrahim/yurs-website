      The Treasurer maintains the funds of YURS and creates accounts of
      expenditures and revenues. The Treasurer is responsible for ensuring our
      bank account is maintained and usable. The Treasurer is in charge of
      reimbursements (together with the President). The Treasurer also has a

      <h2>Vice President of Events and Outreach</h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      The VPEO would attend to the planning and scheduling of events for YURS.
      YURS has a constitutional objective of outreach, and to that end, the VPEO
      can schedule workshops, tours, school visits, and various other activities
      as deemed necessary to that end. The VPEO shall be responsible for
      establishing, maintaining, and preserving contacts between YURS and such
      organizations as may be contacted from time to time for the purpose of
      events or outreach activities. Coming off a year where little outreach was
      possible, the VPEO will have a chance to make a big impact as we hopefully
      return to a "normal" school year. This position is a full executive
      position, which means that there is a considerable role in club affairs,
      though it does not have signing authority.

      <h2>Vice President of Sponsorships and Fundraising</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      The position of VPSF entails finding sponsors for our club as well as
      finding ways to fundraise. Sponsorships could entail either parts
      (products) or cash. Fundraising may include donut sales and others. There
      is a lot of creative freedom and latitude in this position, including
      recruiting people to help at one's discretion and finding new ways to
      contact sponsors. As well, we are looking to improve our sponsorship deck
      that we send to potential sponsorships. This position is a full executive
      position, which means that there is a considerable role in club affairs,
      though it does not have signing authority.

      <h2>Team Leads</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Team leads are ex officio full members of the Executive Council. Team
      leads have tremendous responsibility towards their respective teams: they
      plan meetings, ensure subteam leads' progress, create timelines and
      deadlines, and more. Overall, team leads are the technical heads of their
      teams and have tremendous say over all designs and other technical
      matters. Team leads are also responsible for ensuring their team has a
      consistent membership, as well as promotion within the team (e.g. subteam
      leads). This position is a major commitment and has a lot of
      responsibility. Team leads are not signing autFhorities, though they are
      the position that generally has the most spending attached to it.
      Therefore, team leads will frequently work with the rest of the Executive
      Council on administrative matters.

      <h2>Social Media Director</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      The Social Media Director is responsible for the maintenance of YURSâ€™
      social media accounts, as well as our website. We have tended to be
      lacking a good social media presence for some time now, so the position
      will have a lot of creative freedom. Ideally, we would have a consistent
      presence on networks such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. As well, the
      Social Media Director can work with the Creative Director at their
      discretion to create promotional material, such as videos and posters. The
      role is somewhat flexible in that regard as the scope can be very broad.
      This is not a signing authority position.

      <h2>Creative Director</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      The Creative Director is responsible for all "creative" material, such as
      the logo, posters, videos, advertisements, and more. The Creative Director
      is responsible for the overall aesthetics of YURS as well as any
      merchandising activities. The Creative Director and Social Media Director
      often go hand-in-hand, and there can be a lot of mutual cooperation at
      their discretion. This role is very flexible as the scope is broad. This
      is not a signing authority position.
